Search through images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces.
E.g. if you search for "lemons" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the image page which mentions "lemons"

## Outcomes
- use OpenCV to detect faces
- tesseract to do optical character recognition
- use PIL to composite images together into contact sheets

## Key Concepts
- Apply the Python Imaging Library (PILLOW) to manipulate images
- Understand what Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Build programs able to detect text in images using the tesseract library
- Develop python software using Jupyter Notebook environment
